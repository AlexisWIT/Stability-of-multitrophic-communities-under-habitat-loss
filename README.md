# Stability-of-multitrophic-communities-under-habitat-loss
Simulation code for manuscript published in Nature Communications.

This simulation code was originally run as a series of job arrays on the University of Bristol's HPC cluster (Blue Crystal: https://www.bristol.ac.uk/acrc/high-performance-computing/).

Some configuration changes will be needed if trying to run simulations in a different context. Please contact for assistance if required:

This code was originally developed by Miguel Lurgi (http://www.cbtm-moulis.com/m-220-miguel-lurgi.html) and used for simulations in the publication:

    Lurgi, Miguel, Daniel Montoya, and Jos√© M. Montoya. "The effects of space and diversity of interaction types on the     stability of complex ecological networks." Theoretical ecology 9.1 (2016): 3-13.
    
Chris McWilliams (http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/people/chris-j-mcwilliams/index.html) was responsible for updating the code to model random, intermediate and contiguous habitat loss. Potential for variable immigration rates has also been added in this version.
