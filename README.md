Simulation code for manuscript published in Nature Communications.

This simulation code was originally run as a series of job arrays on the University of Bristol's HPC cluster (Blue Crystal: https://www.bristol.ac.uk/acrc/high-performance-computing/).

Some configuration changes will be needed if trying to run simulations in a different context. Please contact for assistance if required:
